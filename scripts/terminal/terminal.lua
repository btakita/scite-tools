-- (Linux only) The terminal module.
-- It enables a Linux terminal to be run inside a SciTE buffer.
-- This module requires LuaSocket, utils/shell.rb, and Ara T.
-- Howard's 'session' library for Ruby.
-- The terminal server can be started and stopped with the Ctrl+G
-- and Ctrl+Q key combinations respectively.
-- Pressing Shift+Enter executes the current selection or the
-- contents of the current line in the shell. Pressing Enter by
-- itself behaves as it does normally in SciTE.

-- SciTE OnClear Lua extension function.
-- Checks to see whether a terminal session is currently open.
-- If so, close it because the Lua environment gets cleared
-- and re-initialized everytime buffers are switched. OnClear
-- is called to give scripts a chance to clean up after
-- themselves.
